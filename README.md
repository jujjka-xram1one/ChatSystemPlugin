Chat System Plugin is a comprehensive chat management tool designed for Minecraft roleplay servers. It introduces various interactive chat commands and custom behaviors, enhancing the roleplay experience for players by adding emotive, novel-style dialogues, special chat formatting, and immersive interactions. Below are the key features and commands that the plugin offers:


Core Features:
1. Emote System:
  - Players can start an emote by typing a * at the beginning of their message. The system will detect this as an emote, applying customizable colors to the text.
  - If the message contains " (quotation marks), any text within them will appear in white.
  - Players can choose the color of their emotes via a dedicated Emote Color GUI where they can select different colors (represented by Minecraft dyes).
2. Roleplay Conversation Styles:
  - Regular Chat: Messages are output in white by default. If neither * nor " is used, the message will be treated as standard dialogue and enclosed in quotation marks.
  - /do Command: This command allows players to describe situations in third-person perspective (novel-style). It prints [BİLGİ] at the start of the message and applies the player's emote color.
  - /ba Command: Allows shouting with a 30-block message range. It prefixes the message with [BAĞIRARAK] and applies the player's emote color.
  - /fs Command: A whispered message with a 2-block range. It prints [Fısıldayarak] and displays text within " in italics.
  - /ff Command: Similar to /fs, but with a 7-block message range. It prints [Sessizce] and applies italics to the quoted text.
  - /kf Command: A private conversation command used when players are standing next to each other (within 1 block). The message is delivered in a special format, outputting the text as a whisper (e.g., "Character_Name eğilip yanındakinin kulağına bir şeyler fısıldadı").
3. Out of Character (OOC) Chat:
  - /OOC Command: For local OOC chat (20-block range), displaying the player’s Minecraft name followed by their message in plain text.
  - /GOOC Command: For global OOC chat. The message can be toggled by players who wish to opt out of seeing it, maintaining focus on roleplay chat.
4. Blocked by Structure:
  - If players are separated by physical structures (walls, blocks, etc.), those who cannot hear the other player will receive muffled messages (e.g., boğuk bir gürültü), indicating that the other person’s voice is blocked by the environment.
5. Character Names:
  - The plugin includes support for character names, allowing players to use their roleplay identities instead of their Minecraft usernames.
6. Logging and Server Config:
  - All chat interactions are logged in server logs, providing transparency and accountability for admins.

Emote Color GUI:
Players can customize their emote colors through the Emote Color GUI, where they can select a color based on Minecraft dyes. The plugin supports adding, removing, and modifying colors, with permissions for different colors to be set later as needed.
